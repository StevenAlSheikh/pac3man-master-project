Pac3man AI Project — CS450: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
Engineered intelligent agents for the Pac3man simulation using Python, applying foundational AI principles in a game-based environment.

Implemented classical search algorithms — Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), and A* — to efficiently solve maze navigation and food-gathering problems.

Developed competitive multi-agent strategies utilizing Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Expectimax to model adversarial behavior and probabilistic decision-making.

Completed and optimized core assignments from the Pac3man Search and Pac3man MultiAgent repositories, reinforcing AI techniques through hands-on problem solving.
